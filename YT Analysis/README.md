For this project, I received a dataset from Kaggle and uploaded it to an AWS S3 bucket. I then used AWS Glue/Lambda to create an ETL pipeline that cleans and joins the datasets. I was able to query the data using AWS Athena to ensure everything was working as intended. Lastly, I used AWS QuickSight to build a small dashboard to help analyze this data. Screenshot of the dashboard is below.
